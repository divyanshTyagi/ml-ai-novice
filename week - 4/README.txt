I have made regression models using -
 .svr
 .decision tree
 .random forest
 polynomial regression and multiple linear regression were not giving as good results
 
 Observation ->
 1.random forest-> by far the best score and lowest mse -> score(0.7503219401435859),mse(0.22711461980322145) (although there are chances of overfitting
 2.Decision Trees gave ---- mse -> 0.32369563254916645  score - > 0.6151866502534757
 3.SVR -> mse of #rbf  is mse -> .282249799 (2,3,5,6)
